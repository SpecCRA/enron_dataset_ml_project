# ml_project_files
Udacity Machine Learning Enron Data Project Files

poi_id.ipynb is the notebook file in Jupyter Notebook I organized

poi_id.py is the python file you can run. Everything in it should work! I hope it's formatted properly.

project_free_response.rtf includes the answers to the free response questions in the project. 

emails_by_addresses.zip is added because submitter said it had too many files initially. You may have to unzip this file first to run code.

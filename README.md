# Machine Learning with Enron Dataset Project 

## Description
This repository contains all files from Udacity's Intro to Machine Learning project. In this project, I used a couple classifiers to test accuracy in fraud detection. 

**These following scripts run in Python 2, not 3**

## Usage
* `poi_id.ipynb` is a Jupyter Notebook file organized to explore the dataset, make any necessary changes such as outlier removal, and test classifiers.
* Running `poi_id.py` will output `.pkl` files used for testing.
* Running `tester.py` with the necessary Udacity files will output evaluation metrics. 

## Notes
* A list of resources used is provided in `list_of_resources.pdf`
* Answers to project questions are in `project_free_response.pdf`

## Credits
* Udacity's Machine Learning project creator provided most of the code to run this project, namely `poi_id.py` and `tester.py`
